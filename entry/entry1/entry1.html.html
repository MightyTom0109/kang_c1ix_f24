  <h2>How everything changed</h2>

  <p>As a communicative person, I always look for a clear understanding from my audience. Therefore, when I make 
    my design, I want to lay out an image where the composition and particles are very visible and logical. 
    A square is a square, a circle is a circle. The goal is to create a simple comprehension of my piece, 
    thus making it an objective piece of work. I typically enjoy these designs myself, since they tend to 
    be more organized and satisfying to look at. However it does contain some significant flaws. A piece of 
    art maintains its relevance in the community by its unique or perhaps abstract presentation. This allows 
    the analysis and explanation to be more diverse, leading to discussions and further subjective interpretations. 
    According to my standards of being organized, the design would be simple to understand, but it lacks the 
    attraction to let others continue to make observations. Therefore, after examination of the strength and 
    weakness of this designing style, I began to search for the balance between subjective satisfaction or objective 
    satisfaction. Currently, I am leaning towards the objective side, which will be discussed in detail.</p>
