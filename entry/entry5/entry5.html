    <h1>My Experience with Anime Video Games</h1>

   <div class="margin">
    <h2>Introduction</h2>

<h4>As anime fans, we tend to stay home a lot. Personally, I wouldn't go outdoors unless necessary, 
  most of the time I would enjoy myself in my own room, watching anime. This is a time consuming and 
  fascinating process. However, there will be some times where I don’t have episodes to watch, which 
  is where I laid my hands on video games, especially anime related video games. These kinds of  video 
  games would exist on any given platform, and as fans of the chosen anime, I usually wouldn't have too 
  much of an issue with it. In other words, if the game was designed in the exact same way but with 
  characters I don’t recognize, I probably wouldn’t like the game as much, or even like it at all. 
  Amongst these games, they can contain action, fighting, gotcha, role play, etc. I will be going over 
  these games by categories and hope we can all get to experience them with positive feedback. </h4>

      <div class="list">
      
<p>Amongst my gameplay history, there have been a lot of ones where they are only popular for a certain 
  period of time, and we play the game as a group. These kinds of games wouldn't last very long in our 
  discussion and get forgotten after we don’t talk about it as much. Out of these games, most of them are 
  hosted by the same company in China, known as “Bilibili”. This is a very popular anime website in China, 
  where we watch, discuss and post videos about anime. <span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">This is also the host of most anime mobile games in 
  china. Since these are the quick games that we don’t play anymore as a group, it did take quite some time 
  to remember the names, but that’s not the important part.These games are only a short part in our daily 
  discussions, but it doesn’t mean they are bad games, it's just we don’t talk about them anymore. In fact, 
  some of which are still considered classic. Obviously, out of the list, Genshin impact is probably the 
  most popular one to this date, but personally, we had the best time playing soul knight. It was easy 
  to play with, and the more we played it, we got to unlock more weapons and levels. Back then, we didn’t 
  have money to spare, so every level is literally made based on the times we spent in the game. I still 
  remember us playing the game on our own time and surprising the others with a new level of character, 
  which sounded really stupid. Things did feel different once we were able to beat the game with ease, so 
  eventually we got bored of it.</span> </p>

    <h2 id="2">Role Playing Game</h2>

    <div class="cont">  <img src="assets/rpg.jpg" alt="dbz" style="height: 650px; width: 600px;"  >
      <div class="list">

    <p>This is probably the most preferred kind of game for anime fans. The concept of RPGs is for people 
      to relive the stories and go through them from a POV in the anime. It brings a very close connection 
      from the player to the game. Out of these games, there are the ones where they would straight up take 
      the plot from the original story, or the game itself would create its own what if story based on what 
      the fans like to see. <span id="dots6">...</span><span id="more6">These games normally wouldn’t go wrong in anyways, unless the story they made is 
      really bad, or the graphics look terrible. These games gave a very clear targeted audience. Those people 
      who already enjoyed the story, certainly wouldn’t turn down a game that is remaking what they like in a 
      different way. Besides, us anime fans tend to enjoy storytelling more than anyone else. Out of the batch, 
      I really liked “Angel of Death”. This is one of the games where the anime is made because of the game. 
      The game was made in 2015, which is almost ten years, and back then, the game kind of looked in a more 
      pixelated style, which caused a lot of the more impactful scenes didn’t get the chance to release their 
      full potential. Therefore, when I saw the news of them making an anime for the game, I really was excited 
      about it, and the trailer looked amazing. Turns out, the anime was way better than I thought, while having 
      a very decent plot.></span> </p>

    <h2 id="3">Gotcha Game</h2>
    <div class="cont">  <img src="assets/gotcha.jpg" alt="dbz" style="height: 750px; width: 600px;"  >
      <div class="list">

    <p>Many people don’t understand the concept or know what gotcha is at all. The word Gotcha comes from a 
      kind of capsule machine from Japan, known as Gotchapon. This is essentially a representation of randomness 
      and luck. The whole idea of a gotcha is for payers to send in game currencies to get a random item from the 
      game. Obviously, the items have differences in usability and most importantly, rarity. It's like opening 
      loot boxes, not knowing what to get from it, kind of similar to gambling. <span id="dots5">...</span><span id="more5">This type of game can be very 
      addicting, and for a lot of players, they would spend real money to purchase in game currencies. The feeling 
      of getting a rare item in a game is very rewarding, it fulfills the ego of a person, making them think that 
      they are special in some way, they have something other people don’t have. In particular, when the game gets 
      bonded with an anime, a popular anime thing would feel even better. This is a very similar concept with role 
      play games, the player gets to use rare and popular characters in the show to achieve a level of satisfaction 
      in gameplay as well as a collection. Princess Connect ReDive is the game I play the most out of this list. 
      This game has been around me for almost five years. From the title, many people would assume that this is a 
      game designed for girls, but it’s actually the opposite. The player in the game is playing from a male’s 
      perspective, it is a process of getting to know all these girls in the game. The Gotcha element comes in 
      when we can pull different outfits of the girls, and some of them have great usability in the actual gameplay, 
      and for most male players, the girls look really nice, REALLY NICE. Personally, I enjoy the game based on the 
      very high quality in the card arts, as well as the highly produced story animations in game. The game itself 
      functions as an anime, where new plots of the story line would come to the game every month, which satisfies 
      me completely.  </span></p>

    <h2 id="4">Yu-Gi-Oh Games</h2>
    <div class="cont">  <img src="assets/yugioh.jpg" alt="dbz" style="height: 750px; width: 600px;"  >
      <div class="list">

<p>YuGiOh is a very interesting type of genre in anime gaming history, because the anime itself is a show converting 
  this card game called duel monster. Therefore, the company sees this as an opportunity, they made duel monsters an 
  actual game in real life. In fact, there are professional tournaments around the world, which shows how some people 
  are taking this game very seriously. In the real life card game, they functionia s a Gatcha format, where people are 
  buying booster packs and hoping to make a deck out of random packs. <span id="dots4">...</span><span id="more4">However, playing YuGiOh in real life is actually 
  quite expensive. A lot of the rare cards in real life are selling for thousands of dollars, which is when Konami 
  figured out that they can make a digital version of the YuGiOh card game. After that OCG came out, and many more players 
  started to play decks online. Building decks online and battling others can actually solve a lot of unnecessary issues. 
  As many may know, if I were to write out the entire YuGiOh card game rule I need to make a five page essay, and many 
  people in real life get confused as to how some of the rules apply to certain cards. However, playing online lets the 
  computer decide it for you, which is made by the official company team, meaning that, it is likely that the game tells 
  you the correct solution. As time moves on, Konami has developed YuGiOh games with extremely high graphics, such as 
  Master Dual and Duel Links, which can be played on both mobile and PC. Duel Links focuses on recreating the anime scenes 
  and lines during actual gameplay, while Master Duel is simply for people to compete with one another with the official 
  YuGiOh gameplay. YuGiOh is a very mindful game, sometimes one singular turn can contain more than 50 moves by a player, 
  it is especially not friendly to beginners, it is pretty much only suitable for people who watched the entire anime show 
  and participated in real life gaming. If not, then it would take quite a long time for people to get used to the game. </span></p>

    <h2 id="5">Pokemon Games</h2>

    <div class="cont">  <img src="assets/pokemon.jpg" alt="dbz" style="height: 750px; width: 600px;"  >
      <div class="list">
        <div class="para">

<p class="poke">Pokemon is quite the opposite from YuGiOh. YuGiOh is a card game popularized from the manga and the anime, while Pokemon 
  originally was a game itself, but later on got made into different mangas and anime. Fun fact, the main characters in the 
  manga, games, and anime are all different people, but the pokemons are the same. People take their own preferences in 
  going over the franchise, but the game always stands out the most. <span id="dots2">...</span><span id="more2">The anime did bring a lot of emotional scenes, describing 
  a lot of the relationships between Ash and his pokemon, but the game is where I get to have a chance of taking care of 
  and meeting new pokemons myself. I would say, to this date, the pokemon game series are still considered the best RPG 
  out there. I am a person who really loved pets, and the concept of pokemon really brought my dreams to life. It's like 
  taking care of pets who can properly understand human language. Pokemon tends to release a new game in console every time
  a new generation comes out, usually when an anime series ends, and the game itself tends to have a name similar to the 
  anime series. Out of the entire series, Pokemon: Diamond and Pearl resonate the most with me, since this is the very first 
  pokemon game I have experienced. Most of the console series of pokemon all tend to follow the trend of roleplaying as a 
  main character and gathering gym badges and capturing wild pokemons. However, Pokemon: Arceus is a special one. This game 
  has its own storyline, including time traveling, meeting pokemons, solving the mystery, it was probably the most popular 
  game in 2022. I still remember the price of the game skyrocketing when I was trying to buy it at the shop. Besides the 
  games on console, Pokemon itself is a very popular franchise, mobiles games such as Pokemon GO exploded around the world 
  back in 2016, and they also have their own trading card game, some of the cards can value over millions of dollars when 
  graded highly by the PSA. It’s not even a joke that this card can buy you a brand new car. In addition, Pokemon also has 
  action / Fighting games. One of the more popular examples being Pokken Tournament, one of the most nice looking fighting 
  games to this date, with their brilliant design in handling the texture of pokemons and giving extremely high play 
  ability, completely overthrowing the concept of turn battle in most other pokemon games. Throughout these years, as we 
  see the company making new additions to the series, we also see the development of technology, and how the pokemon world 
  has been brought to us more vivid and fascinating. </span></p>

    <h2 id="6">Dragon Ball Games</h2>

    <div class="cont">  <img src="assets/dbz.jpg" alt="dbz" style="height: 750px; width: 600px;"  >
      <div class="list">
        

    <p class="poke">As my favorite anime of all time, and will always be my favorite, Dragon Ball has produced some of my favorite video 
      games out there. As one of the biggest anime and manga franchises worldwide, it is very natural for companies to put 
      in a lot of time and money to make great video games for it. Dragon ball has video games on pretty much any digital 
      device, going back to old gameboys, consoles, arcades, to PC, mobile. Anytime, anything that is made related to Dragon 
      Ball, it makes money. <span id="dots3">...</span><span id="more3">Back in 2020, when they released a role playing action game in console and PC called Dragon Ball 
      Z: Kakarot. I never in my life would see this game getting popular, because it is literally a retelling about the Dragon 
      Ball Z story, with 3D animations and good graphics. However, I was wrong. Every Dragon Ball was talking about the game, 
      and how this game brought back so many memories, and to this date, this game has over 8 Million sales across all 
      platforms, essentially taking over the majority market of RPGs. After some time when most players beat the age, people 
      start to not talk about it as much, but the moment when a DLC dropped, everyone went and bought the pack. Not only does 
      Dragon Ball have some of the best role playing games, but the core of the show is fighting, so over the years, Dragon 
      Ball is being producing some of the best fighting games out there, including, Budokai Tenkaiyichi, Raging Blast, 
      Supersonic warriors, Xenoverse, Heroes, Fighter Z, and the newest Sparking Zero.All of these games, at their times, 
      were the best looking thing people have ever seen, and to this date, Dragon Ball is still breaking our imaginations, 
      making these games with higher graphics and resolutions. Some of which even created their own characters that were not 
      part of the show, some made their own what if stories, some introduced completely new ways to experience the show. In 
      the arcade, Dragon Ball Heroes almost took over the market in Japan and some other countries around it. This is a game 
      where people can collect their own shining cards from the arcade machine. The texture and the artwork on the cards look 
      way too good, many people made collections of them. This game is also a dream come true situation, where the company is 
      creating scenes and moments where it would never happen in the anime to act as a fan service and they are awesome in 
      every way. On the mobile, we also have Dokkan Battle and Legends to play. Dragon Ball as a gotcha game is too good for 
      me. Throughout the years of collecting characters in these games, these games have become a big part of my life. Dokkan 
      Battle specifically, I have been playing since 8 years ago, and have logged in the game for more than 2000 days. In 
      addition, just like the previous two, Dragon Ball also has its own official card game. Not that the card game is not 
      popular, it’s the fact that Dragon Ball has laid its hands on every possible area to make their own game, so the card 
      got overshadowed by the other video games. As the great Akira Toriyama passed away, we may never see Dragon Ball as it 
      was before, but people in the future will surely make it look even better than today. </span></p>
