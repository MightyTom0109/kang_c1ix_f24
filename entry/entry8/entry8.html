        <p>This is the first opening to Assasination Classroom. <br>
          This opening is using quite an exciting tone compared <br>
          to the atmosphere in the classroom and the Name of <br>
          the anime. Just the song alone sounds very nice to me, <br>
          and I really enjoyed the rhythm of the song. However, <br>
          it does sound very concerning when we take the phrase <br>
          Assasination into something fun to do. Killing someone <br>
          should not be something fun to do, not something that <br>
          should be assigned to middle school children. It <br>
          wasn’t till later on we discovered the background <br>
          story of Koro sensei finally understanding the purpose <br>
          of this assassination, and how it is more than <br>
          meaningful for these kids and the entire world.

            <p>This is the second opening for season two of <br>
              Assisnation classroom, and is also the final <br>
              opening for the entire show. This again, resembles <br>
              a very happy and energetic tone. However, this <br>
              is the point where the show is about to end, <br>
              the kids have no time left before they have to <br>
              kill Koro Sensei. The animation really shows <br>
              the tragedy behind a very fun classroom that <br>
              is about to happen. The lyrics are also very to <br>
              hear about. The concept of moving on to the <br>
              future, meaning that something in the present <br>
              is about to end. It may be the last for middle <br>
              school, the last day before they have to <br>
              complete the assassination, or the last time <br>
              they get to see the big yellow octopus teach <br>
              them a lesson.

            <p>This is the second ending for Season two of <br>
              Assination classroom, and this is probably the <br>
              saddest ending I have ever heard in anime history. <br>
              This ending shows the ending for Koro sensei. All <br>
              the memories, all the fun and sad movement e <br>
              class has been through with this octopus. Koro <br>
              sensei is the person that gave these people <br>
              their own direction and meaning in life after <br>
              they have been abandoned to e class, classified <br>
              as failures in the community. And yet, these <br>
              kids have to kill this teacher with their own <br>
              hands. Just like the lyrics say, until the day <br>
              we meet again. There will always be an end to <br>
              a story, but a new one will always form when <br>
              the old one ends, that’s how life works.

      <p>This is probably the most classic anime opening of all <br>
        time, besides the very first opening in the original <br>
        season. The very existence of this song is generational. <br>
        The start of Dragon Ball Z meant so much for the people <br>
        at the time. Unfortunately, I am not old enough to fully <br>
        experience that, but as a Dragon Ball Fan, I really can <br>
        tell the excitement in this song. As an audience, this <br>
        is another chance to see Goku and his friends take on <br>
        new enemies and make improvements along the way. This <br>
        opening itself took over 200 episodes in the series, <br>
        which shows the significance of the song. </p>

          </audio><br>
          <p>This is probably one of the worst angling dragon ball <br>
            openings ever. However, I still do think that this song <br>
            is underrated. This is the beginning of a remake for the <br>
            original Dragon Ball Z series, known as Dragon Ball Kai. <br>
            Many people figured that the original series took too <br>
            long for the frights, and contained too many episodes <br>
            that didn't help with the progress of the plot. For <br>
            instance, the original Goku and Frieza Battle took over <br>
            20 episodes to finish, making it the longest battle in <br>
            all anime history. Back in the day when this was shown <br>
            weekly, Goku and Frieza fought for almost 5 months. The <br>
            song itself is more in favor, maintaining the excitement <br>
            while making a little more metal music in it. Most <br>
            importantly the music video displayed in the anime <br>
            looks so good.

          </audio><br>
          <p>This is the opening for Dragon Ball Kai: Majin Buu saga. <br>
            The reason I am specificiing it like this is because the <br>
            company put Majin Buu saga as a separate season when they <br>
            were making Dragon Ball Kai. This is also a very exciting <br>
            opening in the Dragon Ball Franchise. When I was comparing <br>
            CHAD LA HEAD CHALA with Dragon Soul, I thought they were <br>
            kind of close but this song is better than the original Buu <br>
            was opening in every single way. The animations and the <br>
            rhythm of the song really puts the hype of the Buu Saga to <br>
            its greatest. I especially like the transition from vegito <br>
            to gohan and gotenks. The team understood that people watching <br>
            Dragon Ball Kai are already watched Z, so they put more <br>
            resemblance in the plot.  <p>

    <p>This is a song that originated from the 2013 Dragon <br>
      Ball Z movie Battle of gods. This is probably my <br>
      favorite Dragon Ball Song, ever, period. This song <br>
      played when Goku was fighting Beerus, absorbing the <br>
      God form’s power, and using it to its own will. That <br>
      yell of Goku, stop enjoying destruction, was the most <br>
      emotional line I have heard in Dragon Ball. With the <br>
      combination of the song and the line, it makes the <br>
      battle more than epic. Later on we know that this <br>
      movie was an introduction to the new series Dragon <br>
      Ball Super. I have also seen many fan made MVs using <br>
      this song, which makes this song more than meaningful <br>
      to me, the different perspectives shows the impact of <br>
      the song and Dragon Ball as a series.  </p>

        <p>This is an ending for the Revival F saga in Dragon <br>
          Ball super. This is a very underrated song for a lot <br>
          of the community members. I especially enjoy the songs <br>
          that have a soft intro, but progress into a heavy tone. <br>
          This shift in emotional feeling brings my attention to <br>
          the song. Seeing the sciences and memories brought by the <br>
          series, and potentially becoming better in the future, <br>
          sets the ground for this song, and for the series at that <br>
          time. This is the early days of Dragon Ball super, before <br>
          it actually got into some of its original plots. The Sakura <br>
          in the background also adds an extra layer of meaning to <br>
          this song.

        <p>This is the best ending in Dragon Ball GT, also sung <br>
          by Izumi Sakai. This ending has a very establishment <br>
          in family and bond. This is a very ironic setting <br>
          since this is played during the Baby saga, where <br>
          Goku’s entire planet is being brainwashed by Baby. <br>
          This ending just makes a great contrast with the <br>
          despair that Goku is experiencing right now. The <br>
          purpose of a Dragon Ball continuation series was to <br>
          show how Goku is doing with his family and friends, <br>
          and this ending has done the perfect job for that. <br>
          I have also sung a version of the song just like <br>
          the GT opening. <p>

    <p>This is the favorite Dragon Ball opening for the <br>
      original audience. To many people, Dragon Ball GT is <br>
      the perfect ending for Goku’s story. Although Gt is <br>
      technically not canon by Akira Toriyama, it is still <br>
      considered a very successful series to watch. This <br>
      Opening, until Kai and Super came out later, was my <br>
      favorite Dragon Ball opening. I have personally sung my <br>
      version of this song multiple times in the past, and <br>
      the lyrics are beautiful. They perfectly represent my <br>
      feelings towards Dragon Ball. It is like a fantasy <br>
      that I don’t want to end, while I have to let go, and <br>
      have the memories speak for themselves. There was <br>
      another version of this opening sang by Izumi Sakai, <br>
      which brings a more complete feeling than the original <br>
      version. I personally still prefer this version.  <p>

      <p>This is the very first opening of Inazuma Eleven.<br>
         This is a very surprising series to me, since <br>
         putting super powers in soccer sounded very <br>
         assured, but the show delivered the concept in <br>
         a very successful way. A very exciting start, <br>
         where we get to experience the pure effort the <br>
         main character went through and pure joy for <br>
         every match they won. It brings the simplest <br>
         form of sport in general, seeking higher points <br>
         and meeting new friends along the way. The first <br>
         opening shows the hard work and desperation of <br>
         Endo and his friends turning a soccer that only <br>
         had Severn players into the best soccer team <br>

          <p>This is the first opening for the second season <br>
            for Inazuma eleven, where Endo is starting to face <br>
            new enemies after they achieved a championship in <br>
            Japan. This season is honestly the most depressing <br>
            one out of the three, since they are putting <br>
            beliefs and values on to soccer, which is right, <br>
            and which is wrong. Putting Endo, someone who has <br>
            always been the definition of position <br>
            reinforcement in a position of reality. This is <br>
            part of the character development that he has to <br>
            go through. However, this song, from the lyrics <br>
            to the rhythm, are all very happy and energetic. <br>
            The main reason why I like this song, is because <br>
            this is the song they played when Goenji returned <br>
            when they were fighting Epsilon, which is still <br>
            my favorite moment in all of the seasons.

            they faced off into the international football <br>
            frontier, where they were facing off players from <br>
            all over the world. This to me, is the best arc of <br>
            all the series. The director really did a good <br>
            job developing all the characters in the match <br>
            ups. This is very impressive to do, since each <br>
            team is eleven players, and we face up dozens of <br>
            them, and yet, I can still remember the <br>
            characters on a lot of those teams. This opening <br>
            is also the best opening in all the seasons. <br>
            With an energetic voice it brings challenges <br>
            and moments Endo has to face, while maintaining <br>
            a very hype and exciting attitude. This is <br>
            another demonstration of Endo and his team <br>

    <p>This is my favorite ending in all of the seasons. <br>
      This ending took a very different approach from <br>
      the rest of the songs in the series, where the <br>
      focus is actually on the three female managers <br>
      of the soccer team. We know that in most matches <br>
      the managers are mostly sitting on the bench and <br>
      don’t affect the game that much. These beautiful <br>
      girls are kind of left out during most games, <br>
      but this ending gave them a chance, and put the <br>
      lights on the girls. This is a very nice touch, <br>
      since the audience would love to see a balance <br>
      between the players and the managers. Although <br>
      they don’t contribute much in the games, they <br>
      have always supported the team when they <br>
      need them. </p>

        <p>This is another very nice ending in season two, <br>
          along with Seishun Bus guide. Something that I <br>
          have always been thinking about during the Alien <br>
          school arc is to see Endo, Kido, Goenji, and <br>
          Fubuki work together. However, during the arc, <br>
          Goenji has left the team for a while because of <br>
          her sister, and Fubuki had issues with his <br>
          secondary personality. Therefore, we really <br>
          don’t see the big four collaborate until the <br>
          very final match. However, this ending really <br>
          highlighted the four together, foreshadowing <br>
          how strong Raimon would become if these fours <br>
          were all functioning. In the end, we beat the <br>
          Genesis team.

        <p>This is the first opening for Inazuma Eleven GO. A <br>
          new generation to the Inazuma Eleven series. We <br>
          get to see new characters show up as the new <br>
          generation of Raimon. This story happened 10 <br>
          years after Endo achieved world champion. Many <br>
          people say that GO is not good, I have to say <br>
          that season one of GO is actually OK. This <br>
          opening is a very nice introduction to this new <br>
          generation and our new main character of the <br>
          series, Tenma. We see how this new boy turns from <br>
          someone who had no skills in soccer turns into <br>
          probably the most overpowered character in all <br>
          the series.

    <p>This is the second opening in the first season of <br>
      Go. I do think that this opening sounds better <br>
      than the first opening, but the first one is an <br>
      essential step as the introduction to the series. <br>
      This opening, however, is used multiple times in <br>
      the series, when Raimon is about to turn the game <br>
      into their favors, hyping up the emotions of the <br>
      audience. I still remember when Tenma first sang <br>
      his avatar in the series, this song really brings <br>
      the excitement up and shows how our boys have made <br>
      the come back in their challenges and the <br>

          Eleven Go series. This is the second opening of <br>
          season 2, where Tenma is trying to save soccer <br>
          from the enemies in the future that are trying <br>
          to change history and eliminate soccer from its <br>
          very existence. We can see a lot of time <br>
          traveling elements in the opening and how Tenma <br>
          is facing parallel worlds and trying to find <br>
          the correct path out of them. There are also <br>
          very reflective moments in the series, and <br>

        <p>This is the fourth and final opening of season two <br>
          in Inazuma Eleven GO. This song is mostly filled <br>
          with high speed raps and is showing the final battle <br>
          between the second generation kids in the future <br>
          against the theoretically strongest soccer team in <br>
          all history. To be honest, the plot of the second <br>
          season was kind of bad. I skipped most of the middle <br>
          part, until we get to see how Fei was actually a spy <br>
          with his memory erased, which is shown in the <br>
          opening. I really enjoyed the rap and the transition <br>
          into the main course later on in the song, and I <br>

    <p>This is the first opening in Kuroko no basketball, <br>
      one of my favorite anime of all time. The first <br>
      opening is always the classic one that we all <br>
      love and listen to, and I would say that this is <br>
      probably my favorite first opening out of any <br>
      anime. The rock style music with the excitement <br>
      heading down a long journey really fits my <br>
      preferences for an anime opening. The line of <br>
      can you do it, turns into I can do it, and we <br>
      can do it. Very simple lines, but delivers a very <br>
      strong meaning for the song, and the series, as <br>
      they are about to face off against some really <br>
      busted basketball players.

        <p>This is the first opening of the second season for <br>
          Kuroko no Basketball. The animation of this opening <br>
          is just phenomenal. They have no reason to put such <br>
          a high quality of art style and animation into the <br>
          opening, but they did, this opening looks amazing. <br>
          The portrait of each character on the field, and <br>
          how Serin has been training for the winter cup, <br>
          really delivers a very beautiful story just from <br>
          the opening itself. We see the potential <br>
          challenges in the story, and how everyone is <br>
          trying the best to make it out of the struggle. <br>
          This is the moment after Serin lost last season. <br>
          There is another half of the song that they don’t <br>
          show in the anime, but the second half is what <br>
          makes the song more thoughtful, discovering <br>
          meanings behind victories and the purpose <br>
          of effort.

          main characters are finally facing off against the <br>
          ones that defeated them last season, Touou. This is <br>
          a very hard challenge that they have to face in <br>
          order to take their championship. This is also one <br>
          of the best games out of the entire series. This <br>
          ending is sung by the voice actor Ono Kensho, who <br>
          also happens to be the voice of Kuroko, our main <br>
          character. This ending really portrays the fights <br>
          Serin has to go through, and despite Serin Goofing <br>
          around sometimes, these are the moments where they <br>
          have to be serious and put effort into these fights. <br>
          My favorite part of this ending is when they won <br>
          against Touou, the final fist bump between Aomine <br>
          and Kuroko, and transitions into the ending, that <br>
          was perfect.

    <p>This is the second opening in Season three of Kuroko <br>
      no Basketball. This section of the anime is covering <br>
      the past of Kuroko, Teiko middle school, where we <br>
      see how Kuroko has become what he is today, and the <br>
      reason why he is choosing to fight over his teammates <br>
      in the past. This is also sung by Ono Kensho, and I <br>
      think this is the best one so far. I am glad that <br>
      they took an actual arc to explain everything <br>
      properly to give us a better idea as to how <br>
      everything got to this point where they were fighting <br>
      against Akashi. Since I watched Kuroko no basket <br>
      while I was in middle school, this opening really <br>
      had strong resemblance to me at the time. I would <br>
      listen to this every PE class or whenever I get to <br>
      play basketball, and yes, I started playing <br>
      basketball because of this anime.

        <p>This is the third and last opening of season three. <br>
          The name of this opening is called memories, which <br>
          shows that this will be the last battle for Kuroko, <br>
          and we are going through a lot of the things we have <br>
          been through to get to the finals. The entire last <br>
          arc is about the fight against Akashi, the final <br>
          Boss of the series. The opening is my favorite <br>
          Kuroko no Basket song, and there is a MV on YouTube <br>
          that I still watch to this date that uses this song <br>
          to portray this final battle. It is very interesting <br>
          how the lyrics of this song contain a lot about love <br>
          and relationship while hosting a basketball anime, <br>
          but I do enjoy it a lot, as the lyrics are showing <br>
          the feeling of Kuroko towards his teammates and <br>
          basketball in general.

          school opening, where we see the memories of the <br>
          generation of Miracles in their middle school age. <br>
          When I first heard the song, I thought this was a <br>
          very peaceful and warming song. However, after <br>
          knowing what happened in the basketball club, this <br>
          ending actually turned into something very sad to <br>
          think about. It is the time where you wish you could <br>
          go back to, but things have just changed, and you <br>
          have to move forward from it. The relationship <br>
          between Kuroko and the rest of his teammates <br>
          started very well, but as people change, everything <br>
          starts to fall apart.

        hype and energetic, it is used multiple times in the series <br>
        when Satoshi is having a major fight, which is very suitable <br>
        for a Pokémon battle. This song is also sung by the voice <br>
        actor of Satoshi herself. The lyrics also represented the <br>

        when they do their own bond evolution in battle. I listen <br>
        to this a lot, pretty much in any kind of situation, it <br>
        brings my emotion back up. I have also made several <br>
        montages using this music, and I just find how this <br>

            I really admire, a good relationship between the boys, <br>

            when I watched the show, we were just finishing a camp <br>
            journey from school, so this anime really felt relatable <br>

            but as adults or young adults, it is kind of sad that <br>
            they didn’t go together at the end of the series. XY <br>

      sing this song on my own, but the tone is way <br>
      too high for me. This song perfectly described <br>

      across all seasons. The moment when the blue roses <br>
      burst, really shows how Eugeo has made up his mind, <br>
      and in the end we know that he sacrifices himself <br>

        <p>This is the second ending for season three part two <br>
          of sword art online. This is the theme song for <br>
          Alice, the supposedly first ever completely <br>
          artificial intelligence. This is Alice getting <br>
          brainwashed by the Administrator, losing all of <br>
          her memory as a kid, and later on getting influenced <br>
          by Kirito, thinking that Kirito is the only person <br>
          that understands her. This is a very sad ending, as <br>
          her own life is being designed by other people, and <br>
          she seems to want to find something that she can <br>
          rely on, which later on became Kirito. The <br>
          animation itself is very beautiful, where we see <br>
          the portrayal of Alice’s mind and how she is <br>
          seeking her way out of this misty forest.

          he is going through all the challenges throughout <br>
          all the games he has been in. Back in real life, <br>
          everyone he knows is now fighting for the <br>
          underworld, and yet his soul is still broken. <br>
          With all the memories and feelings he has inside <br>
          him, and Eugeo being the key, Kirito finally <br>
          awakens, and discovers the new form of soul, and <br>
          continues to become the hero of the day. Fun <br>

        It’s a comedy type of anime where people fool around at <br>

        the series, and the tone of the music matches well with <br>
        the mood of the series while maintaining a very intriguing <br>
        rhythm. This song is sung by the famous voice actor Hanae <br>
        Natsuki, who is also voice acting one of the main characters <br>
        in the show. I listen to this pretty much everyday during <br>
        high school, when I walk, when I work, this is how daily <br>
        lives are meant to be. Nothing very exciting, but also very <br>

        <p>This is the third opening in YuGiOh duel monsters. <br>
          This is the final opening for the Battle city arc, <br>
          in my opinion the best arc in the entire season. <br>
          The album was made over 20 years ago, and the song <br>
          quality has exceeded expectations. This heavy metal <br>
          really delivered some of the character designs in <br>
          the show. I especially enjoy the movement where <br>
          they show the god cards in the opening, signifying <br>
          that this is a battle beyond ordinary, and contains <br>
          very intense moments, which it did. The <br>
          demonstration of the god cards really shows how <br>
          powerful YuGi has become after obtaining all of them.

              I have listened to amongst the franchise, and that <br>

              really delivered. This arc was probably the most <br>
              depressing one in the first season. As shown in <br>
              the opening animations, people question why they <br>
              fight, and who they fight for. Going against the <br>
              dark side in their minds, and facing the reality <br>

        <p>This is the first opening for YuGiOh GX season, <br>
          a very typical exciting start into a new season <br>
          of the anime. YuGiOh is one of the few anime back <br>
          in the day that dared to make a change in main <br>
          character. Yuki Judai, the main character of <br>
          this season, is probably my favorite YuGiOh main <br>
          character. Fun fact, I watched GX before duel <br>
          monsters so this opening means a lot more to me <br>
          than the first opening in Duel Monsters. This <br>
          was also something very surprising to me, since <br>
          I pictured YuGiOh to be something more dark. <br>
          However, this is a very happy opening, which <br>
          left me questioning the plot for this season.

              when things get really depressing. The contrast of <br>
              the Yubel arc is so big from the first half of this <br>
              season it makes me feel like I am watching a <br>
              different show. This is also probably the most <br>
              depressing YuGiOh opening ever. This is the arc <br>
              where we see Judai develop and become a grown adult <br>
              at the end of the season. It is nice to see our <br>
              main character get mature, but this process is way <br>
              too stressful and tense. Imagine your favorite <br>
              hobby turns into something that decides the life <br>
              and death of everyone around you, the pressure is <br>
              insane, and eventually breaks Judai mentally. .

              in the GX season. To be honest, the last arc of GX <br>
              isn’t that good, not by the plot, but the level of <br>
              enemies that don’t seem to meet the expectation I <br>
              have for them. I think this is probably because <br>
              Judai has already peaked in skill and ability from <br>
              the Yubel arc. All Judai really needed was a <br>
              reminder of his original liking to the card game, <br>
              which was done by YuGi at the end of the season. <br>
              In addition, I really like Judai’s design during <br>
              this arc, it makes him look like a sign of <br>
              authority in skill.

          seasons. This is a very thoughtful ending for the <br>
          GX season, since this arc contained one or the major <br>
          defeats for Judai, and because of this defeat, he <br>
          became stronger and fulfilled his own hero deck to <br>
          defeat Edo. The change in rhythm from a reflective <br>
          to an energetic tone portrays the plot and the <br>
          mindset of Judai at the time. When he had doubts <br>
          and couldn’t see any of his cards, it was his <br>
          childhood drawings turning into his new powers, <br>
          neospecians.

              anime. 5ds has kind of been the opposite from <br>
              GX, where the beginning of 5ds is way too dark. <br>
              Therefore, the opening in the beginning sounded <br>
              quite depressing, and this is when the tournament <br>
              arc begins, and we meet new people, using a new <br>
              level of synchro summons. Therefore, I think <br>

              Combining small and insignificant forces, joining <br>
              them to become the hope of the battle. It is just <br>
              like the method to use synchro, you add up small <br>
              levels into big ones. Just like the summons lines <br>
              of Yusei, gathering of wishes, forming a pathway <br>
              to the star.

              main characters are off to have their battles and <br>
              challenges, discovering their origins and destinies.

    <p>This is the sixth and final ending for the ZEXAL <br>
      season. This is a very hype song, and it really <br>
      concludes the ending of the season, but to be honest, <br>
      I think this ending should have been the opening and <br>
      the opening should have been the ending. This  ending <br>
      is more than just a conclusion to this current season, <br>
      but from a future perspective, this is also the last <br>
      good YuGiOh season. Starting from ARCV things just <br>
      started to fall apart. Therefore, making this song <br>
      the last representative of YuGiOh anime.  </p>
