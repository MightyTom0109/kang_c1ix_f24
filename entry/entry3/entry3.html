  <h1>What did Anime Give Me?</h1>
  <div class="margin">

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <h3>Although Anime is something fictional and may seem kind of cringey, 
    anime has factual brought me many valuable things to this date. To many 
    people’s misconception, anime is more than just a kid’s show. Sure, some 
    of the shows have very immature plot design and may be called childish, 
    but that’s exactly what brings me all the things I have today and all the 
    experiences I have been through. This statement alone even may sound very 
    immature, but that is the person I am, and I am proud of it. In short, I 
    wouldn’t be making this project or even be in this school if it wasn’t for 
    anime. It gave a purpose and motivation in life and something I can look up 
    to. This website will be covering all impacts that anime has had on me in real life. </h3>

  <h2>Friendship</h2> 
  <p style="text-wrap: wrap;">Although most people wouldn’t believe it, anime is a very strong bond between people. People who watch anime typically have very similar 
  personalities. People who enjoy anime somewhat don’t enjoy real life related content and therefore would stay home for most of the time. 
  It is very easy for us to find topics to talk about, not to mention if we watch the exact same show or genre. This may also be applied to 
  books, movies, TV shows, etc. In addition, it is very likely for popular anime series to make their own video game, regardless of mobile 
  or PC, sometimes even console. If two people watch the same show, it is likely they play the same video game. Even for those who haven't 
  met each other for years, as long as the show is still relevant to them, they can still have many topics to talk about. </p>

  <h3>Same Anime</h3>

<p>Throughout my life, I made many great friendships when we watch the same anime, or sometimes, we recommend each other good series to watch, which strengthens our bond. 
  This was very easy to do during elementary school. I have transferred to ten different schools in the past 18 years, three of them are elementary schools. I remember 
  very clearly, once when I visited my first elementary school during grade 5, (I left the school at grade 4) my classmates still feel the same, as if I never left. We can 
  still talk normally surprisingly, we are still keeping up with the new series. In addition, I was even able to connect my friends in the first school with the ones in the 
  second school since they all watch the same show. It was very easy for us all to get along with each other. </p>
  
  

<h3>Same Game</h3>

<p>Video games are another hobby that I share with my classmates. As mentioned earlier, it is very natural for us to follow up with anime based 
  video games. Sometimes the game popularizes for a while and gets left behind, some are still popular to this date. This can either be the game’s 
  fault or the show’s fault. To be honest, anime based video games don’t really stand out as a game by themselves, it is quite dependent on the show. 
  Successful anime games often are based on a popular show. During elementary school, we don’t have much access to electronic devices. It started 
  during grade 8 that most of us have our own cell phones and are permitted to bring laptops to class, which is when the video game trend began. 
  Video games add a little flavoring to nike discussions when we are waiting for a new episode, it’s not as significant, but it is definitely 
  something very important to me. This allows us to still be around each other even if we don’t physically meet each other, which anime fans 
  typically like to stay in their own room for most of the time.</p>

  <h2>Emotional Value</h2>

<p>In the past, before I started to watch anime, my life was quite dark. As a student, and someone who usually doesn't talk back to my parents, 
  I became the typical nerd that most people at that age find boring. I am really against studying, but as a kid, I picture myself having fun on 
  the playground with friends. I transferred to dozens of schools, and I have always been the new kid to the group, therefore, it was difficult 
  for me to make friends. While only focusing on academic work, and having no one to talk to, I have nothing to be excited for. Things changed 
  when I started to watch anime. Regardless of where I go to, and what kind of people I meet, anime will always be there, and can really affect 
  my emotions, something I look forward to every time school is over. My mom was also happy to see me smile a lot more during the day. I have to 
  admit, I was kind of addicted to anime, to the point where I might forget to eat dinner, but I am glad that I found something I love. I have 
  been maintaining this habit for 10 years now, and I can really see this habit go on for another 10 years.  </p>

  <h2>A Major</h2>

 <p> To be honest, if you were to ask me during kindergarten and early elementary school, would I become an art major, I would immediately say no. 
  I showed zero talent and interest in drawing, all I could do was stick figures. However, things changed when I started to watch anime. One day 
  I realized that anime characters are drawn by people, a very shocking fact to me when I was in grade 5. Therefore, I asked myself the question, 
  can I do the same? What does it take to mimic one character? How are the lines and coloring organized on the page to create the image that we 
  see on TV? I then started to observe and analyze anime shots as much as I could, surprisingly, things turned out to be quite successful. I still 
  remember I hugged my first anime drawing to sleep, and this is when I come down to the conclusion that I can perhaps take an art major. Since then 
  I began to practice drawing anime characters, and taking tutoring classes outside of school, and as the years went passed, here we are right now.</p> 

  <h2>An interest</h2>

  <p>An interest sounds like something very casual, something most people could find pretty much naturally. However, it can also be something very valuable. 
  Many people I know today couldn’t find a consistent habit, especially when they graduate and start to work. People focus too much on their career and task, 
  and ignore the emotional value. People need more than their success in work, but also learn to have a habit, something that makes an individual unique and 
  shine. Therefore, I consider myself very lucky to find anime, something that can be my major and an interest at the same time. The interest doesn’t only 
  apply to watching the show, for instance, collecting anime figures, playing anime video games, making anime drawings and items. These little fragments 
  make up a rather fulfilling and interesting life to say the least. </p>

  <h2>A Personality</h2>

<p>Watching anime also shaped my personality. There is a reason why it is easy for those that watch anime to become close friends with each 
  other, because we shae very similar traits. As mentioned before, we spend a lot of the times watching nike, and therefore need to sat in our 
  room for most of the time, because as we grow up, we would slowly understand that watching anime can be considered a little immature and it 
  will be harder to find people with the same age that watches anime. Therefore, we feel the most comfortable staying in our rooms. While we are 
  in our rooms, we may also find other things to do. Some of us, including myself, took the drawing path, some focused more on video games, and 
  some enjoyed cosplay, etc. In addition, the characters in the show, if they are significant enough, may also shape our personality directly, 
  for instance Naruto influenced many kids that didn't receive much love from their [parents to stay strong and be yourself, and some day, things 
  will turn out better. </p>
