<h2> Kira Yoshikage Introduction</h2>

      </video></div>

      <p>This is a very unique scene for a villain's introduction in a fighting / action anime. 
        Often villains are decided to be malicious, evil, savage, etc. However, Kira Yoshikage is a 
        very unique villain in comparison. This is a villain where he hates to fight. He is looking 
        for a very quiet and normal life. He values an ordinary life like a random social person you 
        can find anywhere on the street, with a little hobby of killing young women. A very contradictory 
        mindset, but makes sense for this villain character. In the past 15 years, he has murdered hundreds 
        without getting detected, because his stand ability can literally blow up the body into nothingness, 
        not even atoms of ashes, literally nothingness, so there is no way for the legal system to judge or 
        find his crime. This little introduction is so normal, too normal that it sounds kind of creepy. This 
        is the first time that Kira has been discovered, therefore he is calmly introducing himself, and the 
        second the introduction is over, he murders this kid without leaving any trace. Throughout this entire 
        encounter, Kira showed no emotions of anger or frustrations, he is gently showing his ability to the 
        audience while leaving a significant imagery. The music played here fits so well with this character. 
        A very calm and ordinary person at glance, but the more you look into him, you would realize the darkness 
        and sin he has made throughout all these years. To the majority of the citizens, nobody even knew such a 
        threat existed. Only the main characters experienced this hard fought battle against a Hannibal with super 
        powers. </p>

<h2>Saito vs 70,000 Army</h2>
<h3>Zero No Tsukaima</h3>
<div class="vid">

        <source src="assets/saito vs 70k.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    
      </video><br><br><br><br></div>

      <p>This is a very old anime, and yet is one of the first ones I have ever watched back in elementary. 
        Zero no Tsukaima is one of the anime that perfectly combines romance with fighting. Saito is a Tsukaima, 
        which is a servant pet for Louis, the main female character of the series. This world has a very serious 
        difference in hierarchy between common and noble people. Commons are the ones who can’t have magic, and nobles 
        can. Saito is a very special Tsikaima, since he is a human instead of an animal, and he is common in this world. 
        In the beginning, every noble around, including Louis didn’t like him, basically treated him as an animal. However, 
        Saito really used his genuine emotions and feelings that changed everyone around him, making everyone think that 
        commons can also be amazing. This clip specifically is Saito trying to buy time for the nobles and the kings to 
        retreat from a war. Therefore, he knocked out Louis, and lied to everyone that he will be back in a few minutes, 
        while sending them off. He stayed on the battlefield, single handedly facing off against a 70 thousand army, who 
        had magic, arrows, cannons, with a single sword. In the end we know that he survived the tragedy, but the moment 
        when he decided to sacrifice himself for his beloved one, really made me view him as a Man. Keep in mind, he is only 
        17 in this clip. This is not necessarily a popular anime, but I still think this is a good clip to watch. </p>

<h2>Dio vs Jotaro: First Encounter</h2>
<h3>JoJo's Bizarre Adventure Season 3</h3>
<div class="vid">
  <video width="1100px" height="900px" controls>
        <source src="assets/dio vs jotaro.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    
      </video></div>

      <p>This is a scene originating from JOJO’s Bizarre Adventure: Season three part 2, Stardust Crusaders Egypt saga. 
        This is the very first direct encounter from the major character Kujo Jotaro and the main Villain Dio. Throughout 
        the whole series, Jotaro has always been the mastermind of the team, where he uses his intelligence and strength to 
        help the crew overcome many difficulties. However, Dio, as the main and final Boss of the series is no joke in strength 
        and abilities. With many of his fellow comrades sacrificed against Dio, it is impossible for Jotaro to remain calm against 
        Dio, even though he acknowledges the overwhelming power within this villain. As the audience, we are also excited to see 
        how our main character goes against this powerful villain. The excitement built up to this point is incredible, and we can 
        also see the great animations played in this clip. The shading and color skim really show the emotions from the characters. 
        Different from the other characters trying their best to step away from Dio’s Stand, Jotaro simply said: “How can I beat the 
        crap out of you without getting close?” That line is so robust and daring to say, but really hypes and tension and setting up 
        for their epic final battle. Not to mention that I still think this battle is the most iconic one out of the entire JoJo series. 
        In addition, the voice acting between the two characters is so nice. Ono Daisuke, the voice of Jotaro really made this character 
        come to life, and I can’t imagine anyone else that can fit the role. However, Koyasu Takehito, voice of Dio, is probably the best 
        male voice actor I know, to this date. In fact, his voice acting is iconic, Dio became his representation. The way he handled this 
        character with the craziness and intelligence at the same time, really shows his capabilities as a voice actor. </p>

<h2>Kirito Destroys Oberon</h2>
<h3>Sword Art Online Season 1</h3>
<div class="vid">
  <video width="1100px" height="900px" controls>
        <source src="assets/kirito.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    
      </video><br><br><br><br></div>

      <p>This is a scene from the first season of Sword Art Online, and it is the second last episode of the series. The entire 
        first season is talking about Kirito, the main character trying to help himself and his friends escape this virtual reality 
        game. In the first part of the series, after helping everyone escape this game known as sword art online, we thought everything 
        was going to be alright, but not everyone escaped the game. A game administrator at the very last moment stole a bunch of SAO 
        players as an experiment to invent artificial intelligence to make military weapons and sell them for money, this included Kirito’s 
        girlfriend Asuna. Therefore, it took Kirito another 12 episodes to get to the place where Asuna was kidnapped. This fight against 
        the game administrator, Sugou, otherwise known as Oberon, the kind of Elves, is the most disgusting, and most satisfying fight in 
        the series. Sugou is having a marriage with Asuna in real life, and is trying to keep Asuna inside the game forever, since he is the 
        game master of ALO. At the final battle Kirito witnesses all of the disguising moves Sugou is doing to Asuna right in front of him. 
        After getting a message from the original game master, also known as the final boss of the last game, Kayaba. Kirito manages to steal 
        the administrator level back to himself, and makes this satisfying scene between the king of thieves versus the gilded hero. The music 
        builds up, and the animation showing Sugou losing his temper as he loses his power in the game really makes the scene really hype, and 
        the moment we see Kirito lower the pain absorption level to 0, we know this is going to be a bloody revenge and demolishment. </p>

<h2>Obito vs Kakashi</h2>
<h3>Naruto: Shippuden</h3>

        <source src="assets/obito vs kakashi.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    
      </video><br><br><br><br></div>

      <p>This is not a very intense fight or some sort, however, the animations and camera work on this clip is probably the best 
        in all anime history. This fight alone is a portrait of the lives and relationship between Obito and Kakshi. This is also a 
        great description on the characteristics of both characters, while showing how they have grown as individuals, how the minds 
        and goals have departed since the incident. They both share the same pair of eyes, and yet sees the world completely differently. 
        They both are disciples from the same mentor, and are each other’s worst enemy.  Kakshi saw the miracles from Naruto, how he is 
        trusting his friends and everyone else. He understood and believed the future would be bright, and fought for it. Obito on the 
        other hand only sees despair and darkness. He is only seeking to hide away from reality into a fake dream, while Kakashi is facing 
        the challenges, for those he loved and his beliefs. The constant flashbacks show how something never changed, while some are much 
        different. The music also makes this a fight that is unavoidable, both are simply approaching each other with all of their respect. 
        They know each other like the back of their hands, and Kakashi knows that this is not only the fight to save the world, but to save 
        his best friend. At the end, he said he had no choice but to kill Obito. </p>

<h2>Saitama vs Boros Part 1</h2>
<h3>One Punch Man Season 1</h3>

        <source src="assets/saitama vs boros .mp4" type="video/mp4">
    
      </video><br><br><br><br></div>

      <p>This is a scene from One punch Man season one last episode, the final battle between Saitama and Boros. Saitama as the main 
        character has the unbeatable strength of one punching everybody, and is facing off against another strong being in the universe 
        Boros. They both share the same feeling of emptiness where no one is strong enough to challenge them, and Boros flew 20 years to 
        Earth to seek for someone strong enough for him to try hard, and Saitama is the person. The animations are incredible in this clip 
        and the fight itself is so dramatic and epic, I had to split it into two parts, and part one is covering the emotions and perspective 
        from Boros. The music is a very strong representation for Boros, where he is hyped up, finding someone who is actually able to stand 
        up to him in a fight, he is enjoying himself, you can see him smiling and having fun. He is able to test his limits, fighting with 
        everything he has. This is the fight worth it enough for him to travel in a spaceship for 20 years. Although he lost in the end, he 
        has fulfilled his life, and died in the best way he could ever imagine. </p>

      <p>Part two of the scene is a continuation of the fight, where this is coming from Saitama’s perspective. Although this seemed 
        to be an epic and somewhat even battle, in the end, Saitama never tried. He never expected someone to stand up to him, and remained 
        in a very calm attitude all the way through. He had hoped that this alien ruler could give him the excitement he wanted for so long, 
        but turns out, once Saitama starts trying, everything falls apart. The sad music is a strong demonstration for Saitama. He won the battle, 
        he beat possibly the strongest thing in the universe, and yet he didn’t feel the victory, he didn’t feel proud of himself at all. He can 
        sense that this is probably the only person in the universe that shares the same emptiness with him, but still, he had to finish him off. 
        In the last scene, Boros understood that Saitama must feel way more lonely than him, and was genuinely sad about that. It’s sad that Boros 
        didn’t give him the challenge and Saitama is sad that he felt nothing different.

<h2>Naruto & Sasuke vs Momoshiki</h2>

        <source src="assets/naruto vs momoshiki.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    
      </video><br><br><br><br></div>

      <p>This is a clip of a new season of Naruto, known as Boruto. Boruto is the name of Naruto’s son, which shows that this new season 
        will talking about Naruto’s son, very similar to the original intention for Dragon Ball Z, but Toriyama wasn’t daring enough to do 
        so because Goku’s popularity is way too high, and didn’t want the fans to be upset about such a successful series. This is the first 
        good fight in the Boruto season, since the beginning of Boruto is going over too much on the daily lives instead of fights like the 
        Shippuden. This is also the first time Naruto and Sasuke joined forces after the original season. As a fan of the original season, the 
        first few episodes of Boruto really disappointed me. It feels like they are making the series more suitable for children, and making the 
        fights nor as intense. It makes sense when Boruto is still a kid, but directly compare him to his Dad, when Naruto was a kid, he had a much 
        harder time than Boruto, which makes Boruto seem way too good to be complaining all the time. However, this fight really brings back the old 
        feeling of Naruto, the combination between him and Sauske, the classic Naruto Music, with many replications to the original season, really 
        brings tears down when watching it. Furthermore, this scene is made and monitored by chinese artists, you can really see the aspect of Kung 
        Fu within a lot of the scenes, and the movements can be broken down and explained as to why this character is making this move. It is really 
        visible about the effort and time put into this clip. </p>

      <p>Pokémon has been one of my favorite anime series ever, which is mentioned in entry 2. Out of the entire series, my favorite 
        would be Pokémon XYZ. This is one of the series where they spend a lot of time on making the fighting senses intense and hype, 
        which to me seems to be the purpose of Pokémon. This fight in particular in the semi finals of the championship for this season. 
        This rivalry between Shota and Satoshi has been one of the best ones amongst the entire series. In the past, Satoshi has always been 
        the one who is trying to catch up to the other rival, for instance, in Diamond and Pearl, as well as the OG series. However, Shota, as 
        a beginner has no experience with Pokémon, but he has been following Satoshi from his footprints, climbing all the way to his level which 
        Satoshi admires during this battle. This series also made my favorite Pokémon aspect of all time, Mega Evolutions, making old Pokmeons 
        shine once more in a new form in battle. Satoshi in particular has his own evolution with Greninjia. The bond between the two and cause 
        and synchro, allowing both to gain an insane power up in battle. This battle also had my favorite Pokémon OST of all time, sung by the 
        voice actor of Satoshi himself. The build to this battle, and how it ended up really can be seen as the final championship battle, but 
        unfortunately, it is only the semi finals, and I don’t want to talk about the final battle. It’s probably the worst fumble ever done by 
        the Pokémon company. </p>

      </video><br><br><br><br></div>

      <p>This clip is probably the best clip in all Pokémon history. Although the Season itself is really bad, with very questionable 
        animations and graphics, as a Pokémon fan, we can live with it. As someone who has watched Satoshi from his first day leaving the 
        town, on to this 25 year long journey, it is so emotional seeing him holding an actual golden trophy on the stage. All these years, 
        the company wants Satoshi to never end his journey by letting him lose every time, showing that they are more for him to grow, I get 
        it. However, after all these years, we can see how Satoshi has become a better trainer, there are people even viewing him as someone 
        to look up to, Shota, for example, and yet, he has never won an actual tournament. At last, the eight master’s league is the best 
        opportunity to show that Satoshi can truly become the best trainer in the world. All the championships from different regions across 
        the world come and join this fight, and Satoshi is beating every single one of them. The build up to this moment took way too long, 
        25 years, many of us have grown from kids to adults, including myself, and yet, Satoshi is still 10. All the Pokémons, all the friends 
        he has met throughout all these years are cheering him up, wanting him to win, and at last, he didn’t fail us. He has finally become 
        the Pokémon master, he has always wanted to be. The man standing at the top with his Pikachu. </p>

<h2>Goku Going Super Saiyan</h2>

        <source src="assets/goku super saiyan.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    
      </video><br><br><br><br></div>

      <p>This is probably the most iconic scene in all anime history. Goku going Super Saiyan on Namek is the most intense and most 
        outrageous scene ever. Frieza, as one the most iconic Dragon Ball villains ever, or even one of the most iconic villains in 
        all anime, really demonstrates the feeling of frighten and despair to the audience. Such a strong opponent caused a lot of sacrifices 
        in the last past 30 years, and our main character Goku, was always the hope in the crew, who always stood up against any challenge, 
        tried his best making the spirit Bomb, but still couldn’t elimite Frieza. When Frieza showed up on the rock, I was shocked and genuinely 
        felt terrified in front of the screen. When he shot Piccolo through the chest, I thought: Oh no, we came all this way for nothing. His 
        elimination of Krillin, Goku’s best friend, triggered Goku to go through this raging transformation. From the voice acting of Nosawa Masako, 
        Goku went through feelings of anger, sadness, not reconciled, all of these emotions combined into a loud scream, making him the one and only 
        legendary Super Saiyan, what is known to be the strongest warrior in the universe. Many anime after this started to make characters go through 
        transformations, or allow characters to have development under upset and anger feelings. Dragon Ball is the one that started this trend, this 
        scene has always been part of the whole anime history. In addition, Toriyama used lighting and a darker sky to show the emotion of Goku, since 
        Namek never has night time. The anger of Goku caused Namek to experience a weather that never happened before. </p>
