    <h2 class="question">Why do I like the show?</h2>

    <p> <div class="container-item";>To be honest, I wasn’t a big fan of jojo when it first came out. Back in 2012, 
        most anime characters were designed to look more skinny and young, a very standard 
        Japanese high school appearance, but JOJO decided to take the opposite approach by 
        creating these big muscular dudes from England. As most of the scenes in season one
        and two were set in the western countries, most viewers were not intrigued by the 
        setting, and it feels odd seeing English people speaking Japanese. In addition, 
        JOJO is considered to have one of the most iconic art styles in anime history. 
        There are a lot of unnecessary lines on character’s faces, giving them an angular 
        feeling instead of smoothness. </div>

       
        
        
        <div class="container-item";>Many people I know didn’t watch JOJO due to its over
            exaggerated art style. However, things changed when Season three, Stardust crusaders 
            came out. The idea of transforming super powers into stands and portraying the mind 
            game in between characters utilizing their own powers was a phenomenon. Each battle
            in the show really shows how everyone is using their creative thinking to outsmart 
            the enemy, instead of winning with brute force. Furthermore, there are a lot of 
            characters in the series, across 6 seasons, but the show does a really good job 
            developing each character to the point where most of them can feel very remarkable 
            after you're done watching the show. </div>

      <div class="hahaha">
      <div class="haha">

      <p><div class="container-item";>Death Note is probably the most iconic anime for mind games. The two main characters 
        are actually demonstrating extra levels of wisdom and intelligence, using very limited 
        information trying to fake each other and bait the truth out of their mouths. The first 
        time I watched Death Note was not until 2021, 15 years after the anime came out. Everyone 
        around me has recommended this show to me, but I never had the motivation to watch it, 
        because I have seen recaps and commentary over the movie version of it, and I found the 
        movie version to be very garbage. Therefore, I assumed the anime would be something fairly 
        similar, but I was wrong. This is where the advantages of anime become significant. </div> 

        
        <div class="container-item";>By using colors and scenes that are impossible to remake in a real person movie, the anime makes the 
            battle between the two protagonists very intense,and with the emotion expressed in anime, 
            many scenes were not awkward as they were in the movie. Many recent animes, when they are 
            trying to describe a battle of wits between characters, it made it so obvious what the 
            characters were aiming for, which leaves no surprise for the audience,  but Death Note 
            does it really good job of foreshadowing, but not revealing what the protagonist was 
            truing animation for, tricking both the audience and the characters in the show. There 
            are also many scenes in the anime that have metaphorical meaning to it, using paintings 
            and symbolism, it provides an extra artistic layer to a very brutal and serious crime.</div> </p>

        <div class="haha">

      <p><div class="container-item";>I feel like this is probably one of the most iconic or classic anime of all time. Naruto 
        is a long series of anime making stories of ninjas progressing, learning, while protecting each 
        other’s loved ones. The plot of Naruto is absolutely outstanding, but the way they put the content 
        in the show made it very annoying to watch. It is understandable for the show to contain memory 
        episodes when the series becomes very long, and to remind some foreshadowing established in the 
        beginning, but the fact that they do memory episodes in the middle of the fight for over 3-5 
        episodes straight makes it very annoying to watch. Out of 720 episodes, I can confidently say 
        that at least 200-250 episodes are not contributing to the actual plot. </div>
        
        <div class="container-item";>However, the good parts 
            of the show are fire, especially when characters get into action, and the protagonist is constantly 
            outperforming the expectations of everyone, it still gives me goosebumps. The animation style in the 
            fighting scenes are especially fluid and smooth, and the way the characters are fighting with mind 
            gaming and wisdom really does show the traits of being a ninja, and outsmarting your opponents. 
            The main character himself, as he goes through the difficulties and conflicts throughout the show, 
            we can see a dramatic growth in character in both mind and strength, while looking back at the 
            beginning, thinking, what a long way we have gone through.</div> </p>

      <div class="hahaha">
        <div class="haha">

      <p><div class="container-item";>One Punch Man to me was a very surprising series. At first when I heard about it, I thought 
        it was going to be quite boring to watch, because the protagonist is already at peak strength 
        in the show since episode one. The reason why the series is called One Punch Man is because the 
        man literally defeats everyone with only one punch. Under such circumstances, how would the series 
        become interesting? This is where I really find the author, ONE, did a really good job handling the 
        plot with character development from side characters.</div> 
        
        <div class="container-item";>This entire story is essentially told from the 
            main character’s point of view, where it is showing how other characters are growing along the way, 
            how they might be influenced by the main character. This is not something easy to do, because the 
            author is attempting to give other characters more screen time, since he knows the moment the protagonist 
            shows up the fight is over, while also trying to maintain the significance of the main character while 
            hanging with others. In addition, the animation of the fighting scenes in the first season was top tier, 
            I still remember screaming in amazement at the final battle on the last episode. </div></p>

          <h2 class="question">Why do I like the show?</h2>

    

          <p><div class="container-item";>Overlord has a very similar genre to One Punch Man, where the protagonist doesn’t go through any 
            competition from the very beginning. However, this entire series is a slow demonstration of how powerful 
            is the main character along with his force and henchmans. Overall, the story is told in a very good pace, 
            where the audience wouldn’t feel bored, but also maintaining a quite detailed and progression in plot. In 
            addition, I really like watching game related genres. In this case, the game yggdrasil is quite matching 
            my expectation in a mid century themed video game.</div> 
            
            <div class="container-item";>The characteristics of the main character is also very 
                different from a generic isekai protagonist, the fact that he is an undead, the way they describe his 
                feelings towards human beings is very successful. Furthermore, from the audience’s perspective, we all 
                know that the main character is unbeatable in this story, but the way he is so cautious about doing 
                everything makes the story very entertaining. The amount of work the author puts into plot development 
                is very satisfying. With the power that the main character possesses, he can quite literally wipe out 
                the world with very little effort, but the way they put mind games under each invasion makes the story a 
                lot more interesting.</div> </p>

        The story had a very goofy start where an entire middle class was trying to kill their teacher or else 
        the earth would get blown up. It sounded so stupid to me at first, but it was recommended by so many 
        people around, so I had to check it out. To be honest, I really enjoyed the art style of this series,
         and it made every single individual in the class visible to me. At the end of the series I can easily 
         remember and recognize everyone. Another big factor in the show is the character development, everyone 
         in the class has their own development in their hobby. </div>
         
         <div class="container-item";>The show does a really good job at foreshadowing, 
            where much information was introduced in the beginning to the point where you don’t think of it as much, 
            but when it was mentioned in the end, you would have a feeling that everything rounded up. Finally, the 
            very end scene when they finally succeeded in their goal, something they wanted to do for the past school 
            year, but at the very end, nobody wanted to do it , but had to. I cried really hard at the end. </div></p>

      <div class="hahaha">
        <div class="haha">

      <p><div class="container-item";>Kuroko no basket means a lot to me. This is the anime that I have rewatched the most to the point I 
        remember exactly what happens in every episode, some good ones even each character line, but I don’t 
        really get bored even if I watched it for more than 20 times. This show really influenced me by a lot of 
        things. As this is an anime about basketball, I started to actually play basketball in real life. This got 
        me a lot of new friends that also play basketball, it was a very good time. In addition, my profile picture 
        on pretty much every social media platform is one of the characters in the show. Another big factor in this 
        show is friendship.</div>
        
        <div class="container-item";>I watched this show during the beginning of high school, which is when I departed with 
            my friends in elementary school. This really made the connection with the show. Trying to regain the lost 
            friendship, while making new friends was definitely a big challenge for me at the time. This show for many 
            people may be compared to slam dunk, which is probably objectively the best basketball anime. If I were to 
            watch this show again at this age, I would probably find it really awkward, which is exactly why I am glad 
            I get to experience what I want to experience at the right time. </div></p>

          <h2 class="question">Why do I like the show?</h2>

          <p><div class="container-item";>Sword Art Online, although it’s not the first anime I watched, it is the anime that got me into watching 
            more anime. This is the show that turned me into the anime boy I am today. The theme, the art style, the plot, 
            the character development, everything about the anime was perfect for me. The way that described the games 
            in the series was very realistic and attractive to me, which is also another reason why I started to play 
            video games, specifically, MMORPGs. From today’s perspective, SAO is probably not that intriguing to me, 
            perhaps very cliche, but at the time, for someone who never watched any other anime, this was mind blowing 
            to me.</div> 
            
            <div class="container-item";>This was also the first series that got me waiting every week for a new episode to come out at midnight. 
                The main character himself was also the person I have been admiring for the past few years, a person that 
                everyone likes, hangs around him, getting together with their loved ones, everything seemed so perfect and 
                very different from my experience in real life. I have been working through myself, and trying to get there, 
                but things don’t work out the same in anime, but I don't regret watching the show, and I am glad that I started 
                to watch anime because of this show.</div> </p>

          <h2 class="question">Why do I like the show?</h2>

        <p><div class="container-item";>Pokemon is THE first anime I have watched in my whole life. I remember watching this on DVD back in kindergarten, 
            where many of my friends were jealous that I had pokemon to watch. I have loved animals and pets since I was a kid, 
            but we abandoned a lot of pets during  my childhood, and I couldn't really do anything about it. Therefore, when I 
            saw the idea of being able to hold on to these pets in a ball, I really wished we had such technology in real life, 
            but the dream never came true. Whenever there is an episode where one of Ash’s pokemon gets left behind, I cry for 
            at least 20 minutes, because I can understand him. </div>
            
            <div class="container-item";>Similar things happened to me all the time, but it was never my 
                decision to make, so I always thought Ash was a very strong kid to leave some behind for a greater good. Fun facts, 
                it wasn’t until high school that I found out he was only 10 when he left his town. Therefore, I am more amazed at 
                his capability to walk in the middle of forests and was able to live with food that just magically appeared. It was 
                very clear that the author was trying to avoid any realistic elements, laundry, money, bacteria, etc, making everything 
                in the show happy and positive as ever, which is another reason why I love watching it, it cheers me up every time.</div>

          <p><div class="container-item";>If Pokemon is the first anime I ever watched, Sword Art Online got me into the hobby, then Dragon Ball is 
            what made me, me. If it wasn't for Dragon Ball, I wouldn’t be writing this article, making this website, I 
            wouldn’t be an art student in the beginning. This is arguably the best anime style I have never seen to this 
            date. The fighting scenes are just incredible, making the tension and mood phenomenon. Every single anime that 
            involves transformation to gain strength all come from Dragon Ball. The scene of Goku going super saiyan for 
            the first time is still one of the most iconic scenes in anime history. In the past I have made countless 
            drawings of Dragon Ball, played many Dragon Ball games, following dozens of Dragon Ball content craters, and 
            attempted voice acting because of Dragon Ball. </div>
            
            <div class="container-item";>Every anime that you may think of cliche today, all come from 
                Dragon Ball. This is the anime that created all the fighting anime. Not only does it succeed in animation, but 
                the plot is also very outstanding. The way Toriyama handles each sag, manipulating the feelings of audiences, 
                making the appearance of each character at the exact right moments hyping up everyone watching the show. This 
                show essentially made everyone related to it famous, all the voice actors, all the content creators, streamers, 
                anything done that is related to Dragon Ball is valuable. Unfortainly, the author of Dragon Ball, Akira Toriyama 
                passed away this year. I shall remember everything he has given to me as a person, as an anime fan, and making me special.</div> </p>
