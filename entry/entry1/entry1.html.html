  <h2>How everything changed:</h2>

  <p class="para">Everything changed at the age of 11, during grade five. This is the year I transferred from a pirate 
    elementary school in China, to an elementary school in Canada called MarlBorough Elementary. As any 
    other new kid in the environment, I was having trouble making friends not only because of the language 
    differences, but also I was suffering through social anxiety. I was afraid to talk to other people, 
    sometimes even when they looked back at me, I thought I did something wrong. In other words, things 
    were not going very well. Since I had no one to talk to, I had to find something fun to do by myself, 
    which is when I decided to watch some shows on TV. This is a time period when the computers were not as 
    advanced, so most families were still watching TVs. After scrolling through many channels, I saw an anime. 
    The framework and animation caught my attention instantly. It was a scene where people are fighting a giant 
    monster, a very generic scene in most fiction movies, but the use of coloring and blade effects made it 
    irresistible for me as a kid. At the time I had no idea what the show was called, and had no clue of 
    researching it online because it was voiced in Japanese, and I couldn't remember what the lines were saying. 
    Therefore, I looked up the channel I was looking at, and scrolled through the entire channel's scheduled 
    playlist, and found the name of the anime. “Sword Art Online”. </p> 


  <h2>Why did it change me?</h2>

  <p class="para">Addiction is something very difficult to leave behind once you get one. As a grade five student, 
    I didn't have much control of myself when watching anime. “Sword Art Online” was the first anime I watched, 
    it wasn’t very long. At the time it only had two seasons, each with 24 episodes, each episode was around 25 minutes 
    long, so it only took me around 2 weeks to finish the entire show. After finishing the show, I was desperate to know 
    what happens after, but there was no news of season three coming out any time soon. However, this is also when 
    I discovered that many animes originate from a light novel or a comic, which is when I began to read the light novel 
    of sword art online, and eventually I was truly done with the story. Excited for what other stories and anime 
    re possibly out there, I continued to look over articles and video games about anime recommendations. Watching 
    a new series is a similar experience of me getting to know a new friend, understanding the plot, and the characters, 
    the art style, etc. Even though I wasn’t able to make any friends at the school, perhaps making virtual friends 
    wasn’t so bad either. Finally, at some point I realized, I have become an anime fan.</p> 

  <h2>How did it chanage me?</h2>

  <p class="para">Since I started to watch anime I began to have hope in daily life. I was excited to go home after school, 
    motivating myself to get the work done faster, and be more productive in doing chores, so I can have more time 
    to watch anime. My mom was also happy that I started to smile a lot more than usual. In the long history of me
     watching anime, I have encountered many ones that inspired me to invest in a hobby. For instance, I started 
     playing basketball after watching “Slam Dunk” and “Kuroko no Basket”. I became interested in soccer after 
     watching “Inazuma Eleven”. Thanks to these series, I managed to make some friends in real life. Out of all o
     f these series, the most important one would be the most classic anime series of all time, “Dragon Ball”. 
     This beautiful series influenced me into an art major. I admired the art style of Akira Toriyama, and 
     started to mimic a lot of his drawings. Eventually I discovered that perhaps I like doing this, and I 
     should continue to make these drawings when I grow up, so here I am now. In addition, I am also able to
     speak Japanese now, thanks to all these years of listening to it. I can watch most anime series without 
     subtitles at this point.</p> 

  <h2>The Great Memories</h2>

  <ul class="para">
    <li>I especially love to watch anime during the afternoon, when I have nothing to do, and it is raining outside. 
      It is a great moment to appreciate the show while not thinking of anything stressful. </li>
    <li>I have had moments when a bunch of my friends who also watched anime sit together during midnight, waiting for a new episode to drop. </li>
    <li>I remember visiting comic cons with a group of friends taking photos of cosplays.</li>
    <li>I remember watching other people’s reactions to a new episode.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>The Awful Moments</h2>

  <ul class="para">
    <li>Whenever I finish one of the good series, I feel quite upset that I won’t be able to see fresh content from the show.  </li>
    <li>There have been moments where I stayed up quite late for a new episode of anime to come out, even missed some deadlines of assignments. </li>
    <li>I have once tried to mimic one of the soccer moves in an anime, but got my ankles to hurt quite painfully.</li>
    <li>I have suffered from doubts and criticisms of watching anime as an adult, they think of it as something very immature to do. Some may even 
      say anime female characters contain inappropriate representations.</li>
    <li>Recently many of my favorite manga authors have passed away, including Kazuki Takahashi, Shotaro Ishinomori, and of course Akira Toriyama.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Questions and Discoveries</h2>

  <ul class="para">
    <li>I have once questioned myself about watching anime. I wonder how long I will be able to keep up this hobby? What should 
      I do if one day I don’t find any fun in watching anime anymore? </li>
    <li>It is very easy for people who both watch anime to become friends with each other. The bond is very strong to 
      the point where I can still find topics with my high school classmate after 5 years since we both watch anime.  </li>
    <li>Every single famous anime, or the classics, all have their own recognizable art styles, and the art styles are 
      always evolving throughout the years to the point where some characters only look good under certain art styles. </li>
    <li>As the years go on, I can feel that the recent anime are not competing with the old ones, because a lot of the
       recent anime are mimicking, or are inspired by the old ones. As similar topics proceed in the future more content 
       would become cliche and boring to watch, especially for those of us who have watched anime for more than 10 years. </li>  
  </ul>
