<h2 id="1">Kujo Jotaro</h2>
<div class="chara">
<img src="assets/jotaro.png" alt="dbz" style="height: 550px; width: 450px;"  >

<p>Jotaro is the main character for JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure Season three. 
    He also made his appearance in season four five and six. Since Dio’s 
    defeat, Jotaro has always been described as the most powerful being in 
    all of JoJo’s universe, holding the theoretical best stand ever, until 
    some of the later ones. His character design is perfect for a JoJo 
    character, and we can clearly see how his personality has changed 
    throughout the seasons. In season three he just seems to be a gangster 
    like kid who occasionally talks in bad language. However, despite his 
    style in language and behavior, we all know that he has his own 
    understanding of justice, and feels sad for those he cares about. 
    Under many desperate situations, we see his calmness and intelligence 
    help his team overcome all kinds of issues. As we proceed into later 
    seasons, Jotaro has turned into a more mature and grown up man, functioning 
    as a mentor character, assisting the younger generation. In season six, 
    we see how Jotaro sacrificed himself to save his daughter. His aging and 
    lack in combat really made him fall from his prime state. He is probably 
    still the mightiest Stand user in all history, but definitely not the best 
    father. We get to see Jotaro change from a high school kid to a oceanary 
    professor, and eventually turned into a father. His sacrifice was indeed 
    a very dramatic and sad ending, but it shows that no matter how strong 
    someone is, they will one day have to move on, and let the later generations take over. </p>

<h2 id="2">Yuki Judai</h2>
<div class="chara">
    <img src="assets/judai.jpg" alt="dbz" style="height: 550px; width: 450px;"  >
<p>Yuki Judai is the main character in the GX season of YuGiOh anime. This 
    is the best YuGiOh main character across all the seasons. The GX season 
    itself has probably the most awkward spot in all the YuGiOh seasons, not 
    as classic as DM, not as good as 5ds, not as flashy as ZEXAL, not as worse 
    as ARCV. However, despite this season being the most mid one amongst them 
    all, this series made an undefinable best YuGiOh main character. All the 
    YuGiOh main characters share the common prefix Yu in their first name, 
    but Yuki Judai is the only one where Yu is in his last name. Characters 
    in the series called him Judai. As an anime based around a card game, 
    each character’s deck would reflect their personality or characteristic 
    in some way. Judai is using a Hero’s deck, which shows how he as the hero 
    is saving everyone around him over and over again. This eventually made 
    his mental state collapse. Judai is no different from any other high school 
    kid in Japan, and yet, because of his kindness and willingness to help 
    others, his peers unintentionally put a lot of pressure and weight on him 
    to solve problems. His performance in the card game since episode one made 
    everyone around start to rely more on him to deal with all sorts of problems, 
    and Judai’s attitude made it worse. To the point where Judai is afraid of 
    losing, especially during the Yubel arc. When he realized that there will 
    be consequences for losing, he began to fight with a tight a nerve mindset 
    non stop, this high pressure broke him, turning him into his dark side 
    personality. Through such conflict, Judai accepts all the consequences 
    and fate placed on him, and becomes a grown up man. We see how Judai in this 
    phase can perfectly handle all kinds of issues in an efficient and effective 
    way, but he lost his original intention on playing the card game. At the end,
     the main character from the previous season reminded him that no matter how 
     upsetting things get, always remember to have fun in life.

<h2 id="3">Satoshi</h2>
<div class="chara">
    <img src="assets/ash.jpg" alt="dbz" style="height: 550px; width: 450px;"  >
<p>This is the main character of all Pokémon anime seasons, the definitive man that traveled across the world barefoot, at the age of 10. Very impressive if I think about it now. To be honest, this is one of the characters that I like based on nostalgia. If Satoshi was created today, he would have absolutely no outstanding points, just as a typical standard shonen main character. Throughout the different seasons, we get to see Satoshi meet more friends and Pokémon, improving himself, and influencing the people around him. Something very unfortunate though, if that we don’t see much progress in the character himself as he kind of resets every season. Every new season he only brings Pikachu with him, and we can tell how the company wanted him to go through a never ending journey as Pokémon is releasing a new game every anime season. Satoshi has never changed, therefore making the story around him, how he would react and behave with different people and environment. He has always been the man that always reminded positive and ethical to all his friends to Pokémon. The keyword while watching Pokémon is the bond between Satoshi and his Pokémon, how he treats them with full respect and care. This then gets Satoshi rewarded for this behavior, allowing him to overcome all kinds of difficulties and acknowledgement from gym leaders, champions in different leagues. In 2024, we know that Satoshi has become the Pokémon master he always wanted to be, but this 25 year journey is what brings us together. Seeing this 10 year old boy still working his way through his journey, while us, turning in twenties or maybe even thirties really shows how time has passed, and our childhood has also turned into someone else’s childhood. This character, though, will always have a spot inside me.

<h2 id="4">Vegito</h2>
<div class="chara">
    <img src="assets/vegio.jpg" alt="dbz" style="height: 550px; width: 450px;"  >
<p>Vegito is a very special character in the DragonBall universe. This is the combination of Goku and Vegeta, the two main characters in the series. The character is born using the polars earrings from the supreme Kai, who is classified as the ultimate warrior. Vegito is a character that only made his appearance twice in the original storyline, once at the end of Z, the other at late Super. A character that only appeared twice in the storyline is my favorite character in the series, very absurdist to hear about. Dragon Ball is a fighting anime, where characters train and improve to protect their world from all kinds of potential threats. Goku and his friends often struggle against their opponents, but later on due to some plot device and power ups, eventually saving the earth. Vegito, on the other hand, with all of his appearances, absolutely dominated the opponent, especially when the opponent has caused massive destruction and all hopes seem to have been lost. When Vegito first appeared in the Buu saga his character design really enlightened me, his intelligence, confidence, strength, agility, were all leagues above Buuhan. He combined all the good parts of Goku and Vegeta and fused into the perfect warrior. Against an opponent who literally killed every living being on earth, Vegito tells him to try harder just to prove himself even better anyways. His personality allows him to perform in a dominant manner. Unfortunately, Vegito has never finished of any of his opponents anytime since they decided to make the potara earring have a limited fusion time while multiplying the power level boost from the sabayon transformation which sounds really dumb, this makes the ultimate fusion foreshadowing to a diffusion and lending someone else the elimination on the villain. </p>
</div>
<h2 id="5">Uzumaki Boruto</h2>
<div class="chara">
    <img src="assets/boruto.png" alt="dbz" style="height: 550px; width: 450px;"  >
<p>Boruto is the main character for the new generation of Naruto. This is possibly a very controversial pick on characters, since Boruto has always been known as a very bad continuation to the legendary anime season. However, this is only true based on the Youth Boruto Arc. After Boruto has returned from the time skip, we can see a full grown, mature, version of Boruto. It really looks like a combination between Naruto and sasuke. I love his willingness to save the village while maintaining a strong metal state with calm judgments against the new enemies. The most impressive growth on Boruto would be his attitude towards the village. Due to the jutsu performed by Ada, the entire village hates Boruto, thinking that he is the villain that killed Naruto. The fact that Boruto is able to maintain his objectiveness against these people that hate him, while trying to help everyone defend the village effectively. Another badass scene would be Boruto after training going up to Kawaki and stepping on him and saying, how are you this weak? This makes Kawaki look like a clown, always telling other people to kill Boruto while the village is getting invaded by monsters. There are other moments when some smart characters discover the development of Boruto over the years, showing that Boruto’s aura has exceeded the power of the memory erase. To be honest, Boruto as a character, single handedly made the entire teenage arc better than everything they made before the arc. The issue with Boruto are all the new villains showing up, and they can all defeat the older generations, and we can’t really do anything about it. However, Boruto’s appearance in this arc has been dominating every villain that appeared so far. We are still trying to find out how Boruto became this strong, and his relationship with Sauske.

<h2 id="6">Garou</h2>
<div class="chara">
    <img src="assets/garou.jpg" alt="dbz" style="height: 550px; width: 450px;"  >
<p>Garou is the main Villain of the monster association arc. This is a very interesting character within the arc, as the final battle in the arc,, we don’t really see him fighting against other heroes that much besides in the early arc, and the final battle against Saitama. However, he is definitely a character that is related to the entire arc. We can see him developing throughout the arc, on both strength and mental. We get a foreshadowing of this character during the fight before Boros, and tell how this is a talented martial artist. His character design against Heroes while still having his own version of justice has been a very interesting conversation within the One punch man community. Besides Saitama, they did a really good job making the strength of the character outshine everybody else, and we all know Saitama is the only one that can stop him. Garou has gone through a lot of transformations and forms, each forms shows a different mental state inside him, as he is slowly turning into a monster while he is pushing himself further, to the point where he accepts the power of god, and turns into a pile of ash after teaching Saitama how to revert time. This was such a big character in the arc that I am kind of sad that he lost all of his power and memory during the battle with Saitama, or else he should have been the new rank one S hero in the association. </p>

<h2 id="7">Shadow</h2>
<div class="chara">
    <img src="assets/shadow.jpg" alt="dbz" style="height: 550px; width: 450px;"  >
<p>Shadow is the main character in Eminence in Shadow. This is a very unique character for an Isekai Domination anime, where the main character is dominating the entire story, showing strength to all the weaklings around the world. However, the reputation of shadow is completely the opposite from becoming a dominant strong being in front of the crowd. He is wishing to become a strength within the shadow, a person that looks like a random guy on the street but turns out to be the tyrant behind all the events and sequences. Before his reincarnation, he was just a weird high school kid that wanted to achieve peak strength, but couldn’t due to the limitation in real life, so he decided to bump himself into a truck and arrived in a different world. During his daily life, he pretends to be a normal student that gets ignored by everyone. There are many moments when he intentionally demonstrates a stereotypical random guy, liking falling for money, and protecting main characters. But when things are out of control, he turns into shadow and dominates everyone that stands in his way. To be honest, the entire anime is very cringey, but that is what makes it funny. Shadow has a lot of cringe lines, talking about the only way of beating the nuclear bomb is to become the nuclear bomb itself. The lines sound very dumb, when he actually has the power to reach his statement and blows everything up really makes this a very cool and significant scene. Many viewers really enjoy hearing shadow saying, I am Atomic, including myself. </p>
</div>
<h2 id="8">Fei Rune</h2>
<div class="chara">
    <img src="assets/fei.jpg" alt="dbz" style="height: 550px; width: 450px;"  >
<p>Fei Rune is a character that appeared in the early episodes of Inazuma Eleven Go Season 2 Chrono Stone. This is a mysterious boy from the future that claims to come to help Tenma and the others to protect soccer in history. The first time when I watched the show, I thought this was the son of one of the main characters in the present time, kind of similar to cannon in the original Inazuma Eleven series. However, despite me thinking that, I don’t recall any of the appearances from the members we already know. Of course, later on we know that he is the son of Kinako. This is a very sad kid where he lost his mother when she gave birth to him, and his father abandoned him due to complicated reasons. As a second generation kid, he has superpowers that normal people wouldn’t have, in exchange he will age out before becoming an adult. This makes the character appear very tragic. At first we had no idea that he was a spy from the opposing force FEDA, but I kind of had a feeling that Fei is not some random guy that shows up and tells everybody I know your friend. As we proceed into the storyline, we get to see how Fei becomes more mature and reveals he has been holding back this entire time. The moment when his memories got back and he started to oppose the main characters, I thought this was the most sick moment of the character. We can also see how the second generation kids have a significantly higher IQ and capability, the moment when he meets his dad, shows the inside emotions of the character, leading to truly one of Tenma’s best alliances. It is kind of sad that in the end he loses all of his powers to regain the life time, but still I think Fei deserved a very nice ending. </p>
</div>
<h2 id="9">Akashi Sejuro</h2>
<div class="chara">
    <img src="assets/akashi.jpg" alt="dbz" style="height: 550px; width: 450px;"  >
<p>Akashi is one of the main characters in Kuroko no basketball. This is probably my favorite character in all anime. I am still using his name as a video game ID, and I am using his image for my profile on every social media platform. This is the captain of the Generation of Miracles, and the final opponent for Kuroko and Kawaki to overcome. Throughout the entire series, people have been hyping up his character, showing that he is the final boss of the series. As a captain, we can see a natural talent and aura of leadership inside him, making this a character that naturally stands at the top of the hierarchy, making other people working under him. This is a quality that I wish to have if I want to become a manager class worker. In addition, in terms of characteristics, Akashi is good in every school subject, as his reputation is to gain victory regardless of field or subject. Therefore, making him the literal perfect person in the entire anime. His design of two personalities also symbolizes the change of the team, from teamwork to individual play as they all have their own talents and abilities. I personally like the emperor's personality more, as he demonstrated a greater leadership, with his power and aura. However, putting victory before anything will never affect your relationships and team, something very important regardless of basketball or not. During the last game and middle school, we do see the downside of Akashi. As a person who never experienced defeat in any way, he is extremely weak mentally, as one defeat collapsed him immediately. This is very similar to my behavior during elementary school, a very strong eagerness to win. After his defeat, we see a character development, making Akashi completely in the movie. One thing I am not looking up to, would be his height, since he is a point guard, he is honestly quite short for a high school boy. It is also kind of funny how he is always mentioning his height issues. When he made the dunk on Kagami and said you thought only tall people can do this, it was probably the funniest moment in the last game.
