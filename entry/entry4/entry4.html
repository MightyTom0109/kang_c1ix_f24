<h2 id="1">Dragon Ball Z</h2>

<img src="assets/goku.jpg" alt="dbz" style="width:1550px;height:500px;">

<p>Dragon ball z is where everything started, it is still my favorite anime, and the artworks 
  from Akira toriyama still seem very impressive to me. The art style from this famous artist 
  really encouraged me to attempt drawing when I was a kid. I started to mimic a lot of his 
  drawings although it looked really messed up at first, but as time moved on I began to pay 
  more attention to the lines, composition, the coloring, shading, these aspects one by one 
  makes the beautiful character I love to this date. I practiced drawing straight lines without 
  using a ruler, making shapes more precise, and attempted colors with various combinations because 
  I don’t want to make a mimic of his work look bad. It was at some point I realized I am already 
  into art as a major, because I loved the work created by this japanese manga artist. </p>

<h2 id="2">Mimicing and Sketching</h2>
<div class="img">
<img src="assets/mimic1.jpg" alt="dbz" style="width:250px;height:330px;">
<img src="assets/mimic 2.jpg" alt="dbz" style="width:250px;height:330px;">

<img src="assets/mimic4.jpg" alt="dbz" style="width:250px;height:330px;">
</div>

<p>In the early days, I have been trying to mimic the drawings from the anime, or some images 
  that you can find online about the anime. However it didn’t turn out very well. Since I am taking 
  these drawings very seriously, it often takes a very long time to get the lines, shapes organized 
  in the way I want them to be. I didn’t have the knowledge nor the skill to make this process more 
  efficient, therefore, I ended up ruining a lot of paper because I used the eraser too much, it broke 
  the paper. However, I was having fun, truly having fun. Everytime when a piece was complete, I felt I 
  accomplished something, something amazing to myself, something I found myself perhaps actually good at. 
  Obviously, I wasn’t thinking about making this my major at the time, but it was still something I could 
  show off to my classmates and parents. I was only able to use pencils and colored pencils, since these 
  materials were forgiving if mistakes were made, which I do a lot. In addition, we only had A4 sized 
  printing paper at my house, materials such as markers, the ink would penetrate the page, making the 
  drawing very uncontrollable for me at the time. From today’s perspective, I would think those drawings 
  are pretty bad, some even unacceptable, but I am glad that’s how everything started.  </p>

<h2 id="3">Learning Professionally</h2>

<p>After some time drawing anime characters using colored pencils, I have found some significant issues. 
  As a kid I really wanted to shine in the class, and my drawings did help me a lot, but at some point I 
  realized I am not making improvements. Despite having a lot of fun, I figured making the tenth drawing 
  didn’t feel any different from the first one, some of which felt worse. It is still possible to get some 
  drawing done in a quality I was happy with, but I wasn’t learning anything, and one drawing took too long 
  to make, and most importantly, without reference images, I could only draw stick figures. With all of these 
  aspects combined, I decided to take art classes outside of school. A decision that my parents were very surprised 
  about. Like many other kids I didn’t really like school, I rather spent most of my time on the TV, so me actively 
  wanting to learn something made them really happy. </p>

  <h3>My experiences with Sketching</h3>

  <p>Learning art usually starts with learning how to sketch and mimic, kind of what I am already 
    doing, but more efficiently. Instead of drawing 2 dimensional characters, we focused more on real 
    life objects. It started with drawing geometric objects, then to fruits, bottles, plates, human body 
    parts, etc. These drawings allow us to get an understanding of space and lighting, how to apply shading 
    to the drawing making the piece more realistic and three dimensional. To be honest, it was very hard for 
    me at the beginning of the first few classes, since there weren’t any specific lines or shapes for me to 
    follow. With real objects, I need to organize the composition myself while applying shading without using 
    any colors. There were also many moments where I wanted to give up, since the reason I started to draw was 
    because I love anime. Not only do we not touch anime related drawings in class but also everything was black 
    and white. The works were very mentally draining, but my teachers were telling me if you want to succeed in art, 
    this is only the fundamentals and is something you have to learn. </p>

<h2 id="4">Experiencing with different matrials</h2>

</div>

<p>As mentioned earlier, making black and white sketches with pencils can be very mentally draining, and in the 
  future if I were to major in art, only knowing how to sketch is not enough. After practicing and learning to sketch 
  for three to four years, I began to proceed into different materials, including markers, oil painting, water coloring, 
  crayons, etc. I am really glad that I made this decision, it fulfills my journey in art, while being very refreshing to 
  the mind, brings tons of emotional value. In addition, despite me hating on making black and white sketches for all those 
  years, I have to admit, practicing those sketches did help me a lot in learning other materials, because it all comes 
  down to trying to get the right shape and form of object regardless of what kind of medium being used. In terms of drawing 
  anime characters, the outlines process became significantly faster, and  was able to make proper shading, and sometimes 
  even using coloring materials. </p>

  <h3>Yair Sasson Art</h3>

  <img src="assets/yair.jpg" alt="dbz" style="width:1550px;height:300px;">

  <p>This is a little story about me discovering an anime drawing channel on youtube, where he makes tons of anime drawings 
    using markers, mostly and they look very realistic in terms of resembling the looks in the actual show. The main focus of 
    the channel is Dragon Ball z, and as someone who started his art journey with DBZ, I was very amazed by his works, and 
    wanted to achieve his level of anime drawing someday. I even purchased the same drawing materials as him, and began to mimic 
    some of his drawings. </p>

<h2 id="5">My improvements</h2>

</div>

<p>If someone were to ask, what do I enjoy the most, besides the feeling of accomplishment, it would be to see my improvements. 
Unlike other subjects, math for example, as you get better in the subject, the level of problem also proportionally increases, 
so it may seem quite unclear to judge self improvement, art on the other hand, improvements can be directly seen visually, 
especially when you compare the two work before and after. The feeling and exclamation of improving throughout the years, is a 
sign that you didn’t waste your time, and it feels great. To me, all these years of sitting in front of random objects, while 
experiencing different art materials allowed me to improve significantly not only in anime drawing, but as an art student in 
general I am more comfortable with communicating my thoughts visually. </p>

<p>Since I started to apply for college, things have changed. Art now feels a lot different than before. It’s more than just a 
  feeling of changing a hobby into a major, but it feels like I have been carrying more weight than before. Before, I drew for 
  myself. I make drawings because I want to feel good about myself. It sounds very naive, but it was fun. It's ok to make mistakes, 
  it's fine if I don’t complete the drawing. I only heard voices of encouragement and compliments. However, things started to feel 
  different the moment when I started to make the portfolio for college. People were upset about my work, anime wasn’t accepted by 
  many colleges in the US, and my mind was filled with deadlines. Professors only give feedback on the bad things, things you could 
  do better, it's helpful, but depressing at the same time once I start to hear it too much. I now work purely on digital devices, 
  learning how to make things with the software. It is what people do in work these days,  but it lacks the creativity from drawing, 
  and now when Imake work, I'm thinking about whether others like it, instead of would I Like it. </p>

<h2 id="7">Questioning myself</h2>

<div class="q">
  <div class="me">
<img src="assets/me.jpg" alt="dbz" style="width:350px;height:430px;">
</div>
<div class="p">
<p>I have questioned myself many times throughout the years. Taking art as a major, meaning that it would be quite limited as to what 
  I can do in the future when I graduate. Before, I always thought I was the special kid in the class, super good at drawing, but things 
  changed, as I grew up. More and more talented people show up around me, and soon I figured I am not the best artist in the grade anymore. 
  There were moments where I felt discouraged, since I thought art was what made me special and standout from the grade. I was ok about not 
  being the best at other subjects as long as I was the best at art, but when I realized I am not the best at any subject, I felt empty. 
  
  <br><br><br><br><br>I questioned whether art was actually my thing, since my beginning was literally wanting to draw anime characters. I didn't have any tragic 
  backstories, nor a great dream to accomplish. I worried about the future and the present, but forgot about all those times where I felt 
  great because of drawing anime characters. Even to this date, I still have moments where I might not keep up with the rest of the class. 
  Am I wasting time in this college, is this the proper major for me? All these concerns stress me out, but at the end of the day, one thing 
  doesn’t change. Watching anime still makes me happy, no matter what context I am in. </p>
